# TREND: Watermarker Library

The watermarker library is the hearth of the project because it is the foundation for different
other components. It can be used to embed or extract a watermark directly in or from text.

Keep in mind that the library isn't a stand-alone application. It can be used in different
applications build with Java or Kotlin (JVM and JS) to embed and extract watermarks. When searching
for a running application, have a look at the CLI or webinterface tool in this project repository.
